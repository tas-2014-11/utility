Here are a few utilities.

* dot1d

<blockquote>
  Queries the SNMP BRIDGE-MIB (802.1D) on an Ethernet switch
  to generate a list of MAC and IP addresses visible on each port.
  Useful for quick and dirty documentation of a rapidly changing
  network.
</blockquote>

* gotcache

<blockquote>
  Two small tools for playing with page cache on Linux.
  <code>gotcache</code>
  tells which pages of a file are resident in the page cache.
  <code>dontneed</code>
  removes a file from the page cache.
</blockquote>

* merge-threaddump

<blockquote>
  Sometimes a particular thread in a a Java progrem eats more CPU than
  it should.  This tool helps figure out what a greedy thread is doing
  by combining a Java thread dump (generated by sending SIGQUIT to the
  JVM) with CPU consumption and start time data (generated by ps).
